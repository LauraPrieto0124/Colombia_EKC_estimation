# Colombia EKC Estimation

This repository contains the data, scripts, and results for my Master's thesis project on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for Colombia.  
The project involves spatial econometric analysis, exploratory data analysis, and Bayesian model averaging.

## Repository structure

- **Data/**  
  Contains all the datasets employed in the project, including socio-economic variables, satellite imagery (NTL, SO4, etc.), and derived indicators used in the estimation.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (ESDA)/**  
  Scripts and notebooks written in **Python** for data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and spatial exploratory analysis.  

- **Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA)/**  
  Stata `.do` files and outputs for the BMA estimations. This section focuses on model uncertainty and the robustness of the EKC specification.  

- **Figures/**  
  Graphical outputs, maps, and visualizations generated during the analysis.  

- **NTL validation/**  
  Contains validation steps and supporting material related to the Night-Time Lights (NTL) data.

## Tools and languages

- **Python** (Exploratory Data Analysis, ESDA, data wrangling, mapping).  
- **Stata** (Bayesian Model Averaging and econometric estimations).

## Notes

- The repository includes both raw and processed datasets in the `Data/` folder.  
- GeoJSON and CSV files are directly accessible for reproducibility.  
- Results and figures are reproducible from the provided scripts.  
- Repository is structured to ensure clarity between raw data, analysis scripts, and outputs.
